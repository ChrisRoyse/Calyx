# Calyx — Master PRD Index

**Product.** Calyx — a database engine for the Calculus of Association (Royse, 3 Jun 2026). Stores every datum as a **Teleological Constellation (TCT)** — one input measured through N frozen embedders ("lenses") — computes **Derived Data Abundance (DDA)** cross-terms, measures each lens's **bits about real outcomes**, autonomously finds the **grounding kernel** of any dataset, guards generation with the **per-output cosine gate `Gτ`**, self-optimizes with use.

**Vision (the real frame).** Calyx is **the universal database**: serves the root core purpose of **every** paradigm (relational, document, key-value, columnar/OLAP, graph, time-series, full-text, vector, blob) on one ordered transactional core, with the **Association Engine** as crown layer that *subsumes* the search-shaped paradigms and adds DDA, the multi-scope grounding kernel, `Gτ`, and the **Oracle** (consequence prediction). AGI substrate of the Royse corpus, built as a database (`20`, `21`, `22`). **Use it for any project; Leapable.ai is one consumer among many** (ContextGraph, Polis/socialmedia2, ClipCannon, any future project). Binding charter: `DOCTRINE.md`.

**Leapable deployment scope (one project's choice).** For *Leapable* specifically, Calyx **replaces only the end-user SQLite/`sqlite-vec` Vaults**; Leapable's central **PostgreSQL 18 control plane stays untouched** (customers, billing, creator metadata, queries, outbox). A per-project decision for a mature production system, **not** a Calyx limit — a greenfield project can put *everything* (control-plane data via the general data layer + intelligence via the Association Engine) in Calyx (`15`, `20`).

**One-line thesis.** Intelligence is the measurement and composition of associations; a database whose native record is the association-constellation, whose native operations are measure/count/differentiate/compose, and whose native math is baked-in GPU linear algebra, *is* the substrate for that calculus. SQL stores rows; Calyx stores meaning.

**Calyx is a living intelligence (A31).** It runs the calculus of association *continuously* while healing, learning, and growing itself → by the thesis's own definition, an active life-like intelligence substrate, not a passive store (Living System Map: `DOCTRINE §1b`). Operational intelligence + life-like behavior are claimed and measured; consciousness/qualia are not.

## Glossary (canonical terms — used verbatim across all docs)

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Lens** | A frozen embedder. Trained on a corpus, weights frozen → a measurement instrument reporting where an input sits in that corpus's association web. Synonym for the paper's "instrument" / "frozen embedder". |
| **Slot** | A named, fixed-shape position in the panel that one lens fills. `(slot_id, dim, dtype, modality, lens_id)`. |
| **Panel** | The ordered set of all active slots for a domain. The designable basis of meaning. |
| **Constellation / TCT** | The fundamental Calyx record: one input × the panel = a set of slot-vectors + scalars + provenance. The unit of storage, search, and naming. |
| **Cross-term** | A `(N choose 2)` association-between-associations derived from two slots of the same constellation (concat / interaction / agreement). |
| **DDA** | Derived Data Abundance: n inputs × N lenses → up to `n·(N + C(N,2) + 1)` structured signals. |
| **Signal / bits** | Mutual information a slot (or cross-term) carries about a real outcome, in bits. The differentiation currency. |
| **Differentiation contract** | Admission rule for a lens: must add ≥ **0.05 bits** about a real outcome; no pair may correlate above **0.6**. |
| **`n_eff`** | Effective number of non-redundant lenses (effective rank of the panel under the redundancy graph). |
| **Grounding kernel** | The ≈1% minimum-feedback-vertex-set of the association graph that, once anchored to real outcomes, regenerates ≈99% by association. |
| **`Gτ`** | Per-output cosine guard. A generated/queried vector passes only if its cosine to the matched constellation slot ≥ `τ` for the required slots; else it is a new safe region. |
| **Anchor** | The point where a constellation touches non-linguistic reality (an oracle/outcome label). Grounding channel. Without it, association is circular. |
| **Aster** | Calyx's on-disk columnar constellation format (`.aster`); also the ordered transactional core that hosts every paradigm as a key-encoding layer. |
| **Collection** | A named container that behaves as any data model (Records/Documents/KV/TimeSeries/Blob/Constellations); 0 lenses = plain store, ≥1 lens = intelligence (progressive enhancement). |
| **General data layer** | The relational/document/KV/columnar/TS/blob layer over Aster (FoundationDB-style) that makes Calyx a complete database, not only an intelligence engine. |
| **The Oracle** | The capability that predicts the grounded consequences of an action (butterfly effect / world model), capped at oracle self-consistency, gated by panel sufficiency `I(panel; oracle)`. |
| **Super-intelligence predicate** | Per-domain, falsifiable: oracle-clean ∧ panel-sufficient ∧ kernel-exists ∧ calibrated ∧ goodhart-defended ∧ mistake-closed. |
| **Multi-scope kernel** | Lodestar computes the grounding kernel over any slice — all associations / a collection / a domain / a query subgraph / a time window / a tenant / a filter. |
| **Epistemic symmetry** | Q↔A bidirectional: Calyx walks meaning both forward (question→answer) and reverse (answer→question/cause). |
| **Array bundle** | The physical form of a constellation: one co-located, self-organizing group of [all lens vectors][scalars][anchors][cross-terms][bits][guard][provenance], structurally invariant to N (`23`). |
| **TurboQuant** | Google's data-oblivious, online, near-optimal vector quantizer with an unbiased inner-product estimator and ~zero indexing time — Calyx's default slot compressor (`23`). |
| **Measured compression** | Compress to the most aggressive level that Assay/Ward prove preserves intelligence (bits/cosine/FAR/kernel-recall); A25. |
| **Temporal lenses (E2/E3/E4)** | Recency (decay), periodic (hour/day rhythm), sequence (position) — from ContextGraph; **search/retrieval only**, AP-60 never-dominant post-retrieval boost. |
| **Recurrence series** | One deduplicated event + its many timestamped occurrences; repeat patterns read off it; the Oracle predicts the next occurrence (`25`). |
| **TCT dedup** | Deduplication by cosine-`Gτ` agreement across required content slots (no-flatten; temporal excluded); recurrences collapse into a series (A28). |
| **Recurrence signature** | All content lenses agree (same action) + temporal lenses differ (different time) ⇒ the same action across time, detected automatically (A29). |
| **Grounded recurrence** | Event-time + dedup-count as a grounded signal (frequency, cadence, **oracle self-consistency**, temporal co-occurrence/causality, kernel importance, information/surprise) used optimally system-wide (`25 §4c`, A29). |
| **Living intelligence** | Calyx runs the calculus of association continuously while healing/learning/growing itself → a life-like intelligence substrate; operational intelligence claimed, not consciousness (A31, `DOCTRINE §1b`). |
| **Living System Map** | The mapping of life/cognitive functions (perception, memory, cognition, homeostasis, foresight, immune boundary…) to Calyx engines (`DOCTRINE §1b`). |
| **Intelligence Objective `J`** | The measurable composite Calyx maximizes — grounded info, `n_eff`, sufficiency, kernel recall, oracle accuracy, meaning compression — grounded + DPI-capped; the system's drive (A32, `27`). |
| **Self-adjusting math** | "Recode itself" = the math re-fits its own parameters (fusion/quant/index/`τ`/heads) online toward `J` as new data arrives — not engine-source rewriting (`27 §5`). |
| **`complete()`** | The unified primitive: predict (clamp present/free future) = abduce (clamp outcome/free cause) = impute (free missing slots) — one energy descent (`26 §11.1`). |
| **Grounded label propagation** | Diffuse the kernel's real anchors across the association graph (Laplacian heat diffusion) → the 1% grounds the 99% as a computation (`26 §11.2`). |
| **Subsystem codenames** | Loom (DDA), Assay (bits), Lodestar (kernel), Ward (`Gτ`), Sextant (search/nav), Ledger (provenance), Anneal (self-opt), Forge (math/GPU), Registry (lenses). |

## `BUILD_DONE` predicate (mechanical, falsifiable)

Calyx is **complete** only when every clause is true (full definition in `19`):

```
BUILD_DONE :=
  CORE        ∧  // Constellation CRUD + Aster format round-trips byte-exact; crash-recovery proven
  LENS        ∧  // hot add/remove lens in < 1 panel-rebuild; frozen contract enforced; 3+ modalities
  DDA         ∧  // cross-terms materialize lazily; effective-rank cap honored; DPI bound respected
  BITS        ∧  // Assay reports per-lens bits + pairwise corr; differentiation contract gated before merge (run on aiwonder; no CI pipeline — FSV is CI)
  KERNEL      ∧  // Lodestar finds a kernel on ≥3 real corpora; kernel-only recall ≥ 0.95·full recall
  GUARD       ∧  // Ward Gτ calibrated per domain; injection corpus blocked ≥ 99%; novelty path proven
  SEARCH      ∧  // multi-lens RRF beats single-lens recall@10 by ≥ measured Δ; provenance on every hit
  UNIVERSAL   ∧  // serves every paradigm's root purpose (20): relational/doc/KV/columnar/graph/TS/FTS/vector/blob on one core; cross-model query in one txn
  ORACLE      ∧  // consequence prediction with calibrated confidence + sufficiency gate; super-intelligence predicate measurable per domain (21)
  KERNEL_ANY  ∧  // Lodestar builds a kernel at ANY scope (all/collection/domain/subgraph/time/tenant/filter), each with measured kernel-only recall (08)
  FORMULAS    ∧  // every Royse formula is a baked-in, callable, self-tuning backend primitive (22)
  ARRAYMATH   ∧  // constellation = one co-located array bundle; panel math = grouped GEMM, invariant to N (23)
  COMPRESS    ∧  // TurboQuant + MXFP4: compress to the measured floor where bits/cosine/FAR still hold (23, A25)
  RESOURCE    ∧  // bounded/leak-free/self-reclaiming; the 25-hazard register each mitigated + FSV-proven (24, A26)
  TEMPORAL    ∧  // E2/E3/E4 retrieval lenses (AP-60 never-dominant) + DB event/sequence/recurrence capabilities (25, A27)
  DEDUP       ∧  // TCT cosine-Gτ dedup over content slots; recurrences → one event + time series; configurable at creation (25, A28)
  RECURRENCE  ∧  // recurrence signature (content agree + time differ) auto-detected; frequency feeds oracle self-consistency, prediction, causality, kernel, surprise — system-wide (25, A29)
  LIVING      ∧  // the life-like properties are all operational: perceive(lenses)+metabolize(ingest)+remember(store)+differentiate(Assay)+heal/sleep(Anneal)+grow(Registry)+foresee(Oracle)+defend(Ward) — A31 = SELFOPT∧ORACLE∧GUARD∧RESOURCE∧LENS∧RECURRENCE in concert (DOCTRINE §1b)
  INTELLIGENCE∧  // J measured + growth_curve rises on a real corpus under the loop; math self-adjusts parameters online; compression-without-loss + retrieval efficiency as facets; Goodhart-defended, DPI-capped, no data deleted (27, A32)
  DATA        ∧  // datasets/MANIFEST.md: ≥1 verified real dataset per (modality × outcome); each aspect has synthetic-mechanics + real-intelligence FSV; all tests run on aiwonder against persisted state (28)
  SECURITY    ∧  // STRIDE defenses FSV-proven; cross-vault read denied+audited; at-rest+in-transit encryption verified; erase() crypto-shreds (content unrecoverable incl backups+Ledger payload, tombstone remains); secret-scan clean (30, A33)
  PROVENANCE  ∧  // Ledger hash-chain verifies; every answer traces input→lens→vector→signal→verdict
  SELFOPT     ∧  // Anneal lowers p99 search latency ≥ X% over 1e6 queries with no recall regression
  MATH        ∧  // Forge matmul within Y% of cuBLAS on sm_120; CPU SIMD fallback bit-parity
  LEAPABLE    ∧  // replaces vault SQLite ONLY (PostgreSQL untouched); migration tool round-trips a real vault byte-exact
  DEPLOY      ∧  // systemd unit, ZFS layout, GPU policy, restic, Prometheus metrics all live + verified
  FSV                // every claim above proven by direct source-of-truth readback, not a harness
```

All thresholds (`X`, `Y`, `Δ`) fixed in `19`. FSV discipline (verify bytes, not return values) is inherited from Leapable doctrine, non-negotiable.

## Relationship to existing systems

Calyx is the **generalization and unification** of three already-working Royse systems (proven truth → connections between them are true; iterate to the highest-probability link until it holds):

- **ContextGraph** (Rust, 13 lenses, RocksDB, RRF, ME-JEPA panel/MI/kernel crates) → Calyx absorbs its multi-lens memory + `mejepa` Assay/Lodestar/Ward machinery as **first-class engine primitives**, not bolted-on crates.
- **socialmedia2.com / Polis** (21-slot Constellation, no-flatten gate, `Gτ` guard, τ-calibration) → Ward + Registry generalize the 21-slot slate to an arbitrary, hot-swappable panel.
- **Leapable** (single-lens RAG vault + provenance + marketplace) → Calyx becomes the **Vault** storage substrate only, turning every end-user SQLite Vault into a multi-lens constellation store with end-user DDA/kernel/guard powers. PostgreSQL control plane unchanged.

Unifying claim Calyx makes real: **build the multi-embedder plumbing once, in the database, so no human (or agent) ever hand-writes it again.**

**Hard boundary (load-bearing):** Calyx is a Vault engine — the replacement for `vault-sqlite.ts` + `sqlite-vec`. *Not* a control-plane database. Anything Leapable keeps in PostgreSQL today stays in PostgreSQL, accessed exactly as now; Calyx neither depends on nor modifies it.
