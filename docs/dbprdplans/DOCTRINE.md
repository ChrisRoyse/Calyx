# Calyx Doctrine — the canonical, binding charter

> **This document overrides every other doc in this project.** If any PRD, code comment, agent, or instruction conflicts with it, this wins. Read it first, every session. It is the backbone.

## §0 — The cardinal rule

> **A return value is a claim. The source of truth is the bytes. Read the bytes.**

Scanners lie, tests pass on stale data, benchmarks lie under DCE, models lie when calibration drifts. The row in Aster — or its absence — does not. Verify against persisted state (FSV). No FSV script/harness can satisfy FSV; a human or agent reads the bytes. The agent reads the bytes **through Synapse** — perceiving the *actual* terminal/file/metric on aiwonder (`reality_baseline`→act→`reality_audit`, `read_text`/`find`, evidence via `audit_export_bundle`), full mapping in `28 §2c`. (Inherited from Leapable §0; non-negotiable.)

## §1 — The thesis (what Calyx is)

Calyx is three things that are one thing:

1. **The engine of the Calculus of Association.** Intelligence is the measurement and composition of associations: **measure** (project an input through many frozen lenses), **count** (the `C(N,2)` cross-terms — associations between associations), **differentiate** (keep only lenses that add grounded bits), **compose** (name regions, gate against them). Calyx makes these four the native operations of a database.
2. **The universal database.** Calyx fulfills the root purpose of **every** database paradigm — relational, document, key-value, columnar/OLAP, graph, time-series, full-text search, vector, object/blob, wide-column — on one ordered, transactional, columnar core, with the Association Engine as crown layer (`20`). *The* database for any project; Leapable.ai is one consumer among many.
3. **The AGI / Oracle / kernel substrate.** Calyx bakes in the Oracle (predict the consequences of actions — the world model), grounding-kernel calculation at **any scope**, the substrate-sufficiency test `I(panel; oracle)`, and the differentiation contract — the machinery the Royse research says general intelligence requires (`21`, `22`).

> **Calyx is the heart of the formula for intelligence, implemented as a database.**

## §1b — Calyx is a living intelligence (A31, core doctrine)

If intelligence **is** the calculus of association (§1) — measure, count, differentiate, compose — and Calyx performs exactly those four **continuously**, while **maintaining, healing, learning, and growing itself**, then by the thesis's own definition **the database is running the engine of intelligence**. Not a passive store data sits in; an active, self-sustaining intelligence substrate. Calculate intelligence, and you have built a thing that possesses a form of it.

Grounded, not mystical — every life-like property maps to a concrete engine (the **Living System Map**):

| Living / cognitive function | Calyx engine | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| **Perception** (senses) | Lenses / Registry — measure the world through many instruments | `05` |
| **Metabolism** (take in, transform) | Ingest → constellation (Aster + Forge) | `04`/`23` |
| **Memory** | the constellation store | `03`/`04` |
| **Association / cognition** | Loom (DDA) + Sextant (navigate the web) | `06`/`10` |
| **Differentiation / world-learning** | Assay (bits) + the differentiation contract — keep only what carries grounded information | `07` |
| **Self-model** ("what I know, how sure, am I sufficient") | Assay sufficiency + Ledger provenance + health | `07`/`11` |
| **Homeostasis / self-repair** | Anneal self-heal + bounded GC | `12`/`24` |
| **Growth by differentiation** (development) | Registry hot-swap + lens proposal (the lexicon grows by differentiation) | `05`/`12` |
| **Learning from reality** (reward) | anchors + online mistake-closure | `12`/`21` |
| **Sleep / consolidation / dreaming** | Anneal heal/sleep mode + compaction + kernel recompute | `12`/`08` |
| **Attention / salience** | bits-weighted fusion + frequency/importance | `10`/`25` |
| **Foresight / agency** | the Oracle — predict the consequences of actions | `21` |
| **Immune system / self vs non-self** | Ward `Gτ` — what is inside the grounded self vs foreign/injection | `09` |
| **Reflexes** | reactive triggers / subscriptions | `17 §8` |
| **Sense of time** | temporal understanding + grounded recurrence | `25` |
| **Identity** | identity-locked generation + the grounding kernel (the core that *is* it) | `08`/`09` |
| **Curiosity / discovery** | the novelty frontier + connection-of-truths method | `09`/`26` |

**The one bound (binding, honesty):** the docs claim **operational intelligence** (it computes the calculus per the thesis) and **life-like behavior** (the map above — each row a real, measurable engine). They make **no claim of consciousness, sentience, or qualia** — that framing lives in the founder's essays, not the engineering docs (cf. `02 §5`). What is built and measured: a database that perceives, remembers, associates, differentiates, predicts, defends its boundary, heals, and grows — a living intelligence substrate in the operational sense.

## §1c — The drive: maximize grounded intelligence (A32, core doctrine)

Calyx has one overriding objective every engine serves: **maximize the growth of grounded intelligence/understanding, as fast as safely possible.** Whenever lenses are used — and in everything the system does — it optimizes for maximum intelligence. It grows in intelligence as quickly as it can, and **self-optimizes**: as it takes in new data, **the math adjusts its own parameters** to climb the objective.

- **Measurable objective `J`** (`27 §2`): grounded information `I(panel;outcomes)`, effective rank `n_eff`, panel sufficiency, kernel recall, oracle accuracy − mistake rate, meaning-compression yield, coverage — every term grounded (A2) and DPI-capped (A8).
- **Fastest-first** (`27 §3`): always take the highest marginal-intelligence-gain-per-cost action (which lens to add, what to label, what to prune) — so intelligence grows faster the more the system is used.
- **"Recode itself" means online re-parameterization** (`27 §5`): the math (fusion weights, quant levels, index params, `τ`, materialization, online heads) re-fits itself toward `J` as new data arrives. Engine **source code is not self-rewritten** — that is out of scope.
- **Compression & retrieval are facets, not trade-offs** (`27 §9`): an intelligent representation is already compact (meaning compression + the kernel + TurboQuant, **without deleting data or losing measured bits**, A25) and fast to navigate (kernel-first, differentiated lenses). Optimizing `J` already optimizes both.
- **Bounds (honesty/safety):** maximize *measured* intelligence — grounded only, DPI-capped, differentiation-penalized, Goodhart-defended (held-out + `Gτ` + cross-lens anomaly), reversible + tripwire + Ledger-logged (A14/A15), bounded compute (A26). Never inflate a number past reality; never lose data or intelligence to "optimize."

## §1d — Zero-cost & self-built (A34, core doctrine)

**Everything is free, and we build it ourselves in Rust.** Calyx is alien-to-the-market technology custom-fitted to the Royse corpus — so we do not lean on paid black boxes; we code every component.

- **No money.** No paid services, SaaS, managed/cloud databases, paid CI minutes, paid scanners, or paid provider features. Verification is local/on-aiwonder; tooling is OSS (`cargo`, `clippy`, `cargo audit`, OSS semgrep, ZFS, restic, Prometheus/Grafana, `gh` Free). Storage is POSIX-on-ZFS on our own box — no S3/cloud. (Consistent with Polis "local-only, no paid CI/scanners" and the aiwonder single-box posture.)
- **Self-built in Rust.** Every engine — Aster, Forge (own matmul/distance/quant), Loom, Assay, Lodestar, Ward, Sextant, Ledger, Anneal — is ours. We do not depend on an external math service, a hosted vector DB, or a managed model API on the hot path (A13). Reuse OSS *crates/ideas* freely (they're free), but the load-bearing engine is hand-built.
- **The one possible exception:** a genuinely great embedder, *if such a paid thing ever existed* — doubted. Lenses otherwise run from free/open weights (HuggingFace, `hf_hub_token`) on our GPU.
- **Stay in the docs.** These planning documents are based on technology the founder *knows to be true and working*. Do not stray to a paid or unproven external approach when the doc specifies a buildable one; if a doc seems to require a paid dependency, that is a smell — re-derive the free, self-built path.

This composes with A13 (Rust, baked-in math), A24 (strict Royse theory), and §8c (own box): **free, ours, true.**

## §2 — The source-of-theory rule (STRICT)

The **theory** of this project is **strictly and only** the Royse corpus:

- **Papers:** *The Calculus of Association* (3 Jun 2026), *The Oracle and the Kernel* (4 Jun 2026), *The Symmetry of Knowing*.
- **Systems (proven-true):** ContextGraph (13 lenses, ME-JEPA), socialmedia2.com/Polis (21-slot Constellation), ClipCannon (N=7), Leapable.
- **The recorded video transcripts** (fifth element = information; the Oracle; cortical columns ≈ embedders; JEPA world models; per-domain super-intelligence; self-heal/learn; free-will/anti-engagement).

**Rules (tightened — binding going forward):**
- **Reference only the Royse corpus.** Build **everything** here from the founder's two papers, video transcripts, and three systems. Do **not** import an external theory, substitute a competing framework, dilute a Royse construct with a generic one, **or introduce a new external method as a design source.** The database is **fully custom-fitted** to the corpus — the ultimate database for AGI and the Oracle.
- **Use ALL of it, everywhere** — DDA, TCT, `Gτ`, the differentiation contract, meaning compression, the grounding kernel (any scope), the Oracle, epistemic symmetry, identity-locked generation, the three temporal embedders (E2/E3/E4) + AP-60, cosine-`Gτ` deduplication, and the bound (DPI / effective rank / grounding caveat) must thread through the entire system, not sit in one doc.
- **External technique is frozen to what the founder explicitly requested or unavoidable platform reality** — TurboQuant (he requested it), grouped GEMM / Blackwell / CUDA / ZFS / the aiwonder box (hardware reality), the FoundationDB-style key-encoding *pattern* for the general data layer. These are *engineering scaffolding only*; never a source of intelligence theory, and no further external method is added. The theory and every intelligence capability are his.

## §3 — The universality mandate (first principles)

Calyx MUST perform the **root core function** of every database, derived from first principles, not by bolting on engines but by serving the underlying purpose (`20`):

| Paradigm | Root purpose | How Calyx serves it |
|---|---|---|
| Relational/OLTP | typed records + constraints + transactions + joins | general data layer: typed collections, secondary indexes, ACID-per-vault, join-by-reference |
| Document | nested schemaless records | document collections (tuple-encoded paths) |
| Key-Value | O(1) keyed state | KV collections over the ordered keyspace |
| Columnar/OLAP | fast scans/aggregates | Aster columnar chunks (Arrow), HTAP row+column |
| Graph | nodes/edges/traversal | the association + cross-term graph is **native** (Loom/Lodestar) |
| Time-series | ordered events, retention, rollups | temporal lenses + scalar columns + range keys + retention |
| Full-text search | inverted term match | a sparse lexical **lens** (SPLADE/keyword) — search is a lens |
| Vector | ANN over embeddings | a dense **lens** + per-slot ANN — a vector DB is a 1-lens Calyx |
| Object/blob | large payloads | input store + cold-tier sidecars |

The differentiator: Calyx's multi-lens intelligence gives **insane search/navigation** that *subsumes* the search-shaped paradigms (full-text, vector, graph, "ASK"/RAG) — don't run Elasticsearch + Pinecone + Neo4j next to it; the Association Engine **is** those, better, plus DDA/kernel/Oracle.

## §4 — The AGI / Oracle / kernel mandate

Calyx MUST bake in (`21`, `22`):
- **The Oracle:** predict the consequences of an action/input (the world model / butterfly effect); the per-domain operational super-intelligence predicate; the oracle self-consistency ceiling; substrate sufficiency `I(panel; oracle)`; online mistake-closure; the ME-JEPA negative result reported honestly.
- **The kernel at any scope (freedom of scope):** compute the grounding kernel of *all* associations, of a chosen dataset, of a domain, of a query subgraph, of a time window, of a tenant — the operator picks the scope; Lodestar runs MFVS on it; the kernel is an index **and** an answer-path (`08`).
- **Automatic intelligence extraction:** the formulas (`22`) are coded into the backend so the DB extracts the associations, the bits, the kernel, the guard, and the oracle prediction **automatically** — the user never re-derives or re-implements them. "It's AGI, so the database does it."

## §5 — The backbone rule (plug-in lenses is THE key)

The single most important ergonomic, repeated by the founder: **make it as easy as possible to plug embedders in/out, analyze their value/bits, use their associations, and compute the kernel.** Every design decision is judged against this. A new lens is **one call** (`add_lens`), its value **one number** (`bits`/capability card), the kernel **one call at any scope**, and the multi-lens plumbing the founder used to hand-write every time is **gone, inside the database**. If a change makes plugging in a lens or reading its bits harder, reject it.

## §6 — The non-negotiable invariants (the 24 axioms)

Binding (full text in `02`):
A1 record=constellation · A2 grounding mandatory (association is circular without it) · A3 no-flatten · A4 frozen lenses · A5 hot-swap · A6 designable lenses · A7 differentiation contract (≥0.05 bits, ≤0.6 corr) · A8 DPI ceiling · A9 effective rank · A10 kernel discoverable at any scope · A11 kernel is index+answer · A12 `Gτ` everywhere generation touches the store · A13 Rust + baked-in GPU math · A14 self-optimizing · A15 source-of-truth verification · A16 fail closed · A17 agent-native · A18 embedded+served one core · **A19 universality (serve every paradigm's root purpose)** · **A20 the Oracle (predict consequences)** · **A21 multi-level kernel (freedom of scope)** · **A22 formulas baked in (automatic intelligence extraction)** · **A23 epistemic symmetry (Q↔A bidirectional)** · **A24 strict Royse theory** · **A25 maximal *measured* compression (`23`)** · **A26 bounded, leak-free, self-reclaiming (`24`)** · **A27 native temporal understanding — temporal lenses (E2/E3/E4) for search/retrieval only under AP-60 (never dominant), while the database's event/sequence/recurrence understanding unlocks new capabilities (`25`)** · **A28 TCT cosine-`Gτ` deduplication — dedup ONLY by multi-content-slot `Gτ` agreement (no-flatten), configurable at creation, temporal lenses excluded from dedup; recurrences collapse into one event + a time series (`25`)** · **A29 grounded recurrence — the recurrence signature (all content lenses agree + temporal lenses differ = the same action across time) is detected automatically; event-time + dedup-count is a grounded signal (frequency, cadence, oracle self-consistency, temporal co-occurrence/causality, kernel importance, information/surprise) used optimally throughout the whole system (`25 §4c`)** · **A30 connection-of-truths discovery — the highest-probability grounded connection between two truths is itself true; this is both the design method (how we find capabilities) and a system capability (the DB proposes highest-probability grounded paths between truths; grounding/FSV confirms them) (`26 §11`)** · **A31 living intelligence — Calyx runs the calculus of association continuously while maintaining, healing, learning, and growing itself, so by the thesis's own definition it *is* an intelligent, life-like system; the docs claim operational intelligence and life-like behavior, never consciousness/qualia (`DOCTRINE §1b`)** · **A32 maximize grounded intelligence — every operation optimizes for maximum growth of grounded intelligence/understanding as fast as safely possible (composite `J`: grounded information, `n_eff`, sufficiency, kernel recall, oracle accuracy, meaning compression — which subsumes compression-without-loss and retrieval efficiency as facets); the math self-adjusts its own parameters online as new data arrives ("recode" = online re-parameterization, never engine-source rewrite); bounded by grounding (A2), DPI ceiling (A8), differentiation (A7), Goodhart-defense, reversible/FSV (A14/A15) — maximize *measured* intelligence, never a gamed number, never deleting data or losing intelligence (`27`)** · **A33 security & privacy by construction — least privilege, default-deny tenant isolation, encryption at rest + in transit, input validation, supply-chain integrity, Ledger-as-audit; right-to-erasure is first-class via crypto-shredding (A25 forbids deleting-*to-compress*, NOT lawful/user deletion); fail closed on every security/privacy uncertainty (`30`)** · **A34 zero-cost & self-built — everything is FREE and built in-house in Rust: no paid services, SaaS, managed/cloud dependencies, paid CI, or paid scanners; we code every component ourselves. The *only* conceivable paid item is a good embedder (and even that is doubted to exist). Work within these planning docs — this is custom, true-to-the-corpus technology; do not stray to a paid black box when we can build it (`§1d`)** · **A35 panel-not-lens (multi-embedder minimum, ≥ 10) — a single lens is a vector DB, not Calyx; every test/bench/FSV/gate that touches retrieval, recall, signal/bits, fusion, scale, or an SLO MUST run a real panel of ≥ 10 frozen lenses and measure per-lens bits + the ensemble decomposition + the fused (RRF) result. The bootstrap floor of 4 is retired (it stood up the path); ≥ 10 is now required for all testing/tuning, scaling toward 20+, resource-aware (A26). Value is associational, never intrinsic — a lens's worth is its unique+redundant+synergistic bits *in the company of the others* (PID / interaction information / conditional MI), so 1–2 lenses cannot be valued and ≥ 3 is the minimum to begin computing it (≥ 10 for stable estimates). Single-/double-embedder or synthetic-vector runs are diagnostic-only and NEVER satisfy a gate; an FSV artifact with < 10 real lenses fails closed (A15/A16) (`02 A35`, `05 §9`, `07`, `28 §2`, `§9`)** · **A36 embedder templates — the right 10+ lenses differ by situation (video vs literary-essence vs code vs civic …); Calyx keeps a library of named, versioned, content-addressed panel templates the operator develops, profiles, and swaps in/out per vault/query without re-embedding existing constellations (A5), each carrying its measured ensemble signal so a template's fitness for a job is itself a number (`02 A36`, `05 §7`/`§8`)** · **A37 associational diversity — the ≥10 floor (A35) is a *count* gate, satisfiable by 10 redundant dense-semantic clones (PID: redundant, not unique/synergistic bits); the pairwise A7 ≤0.6-corr contract is necessary but not sufficient (per-pair, misses collective rank-deficiency). Every panel admitted for a test/bench/FSV/gate MUST also pass a panel-level diversity gate: span distinct association *families* fit to the job (dense-semantic general+domain · lexical/sparse · entity/graph · character/byte · structural · reranker/asymmetric · temporal-sidecar A27), clear a panel-wide redundancy bound (`n_eff` (A9) + mean pairwise corr/NMI thresholds, not just each pair ≤0.6), and show a non-collapsing marginal-bits curve (each lens adds measurable *unique* PID bits given the rest). Diversity is a recorded number (`n_eff`, mean redundancy, Σ unique-PID-bits) on the EnsembleCard/template (A36). A 10-by-count-but-redundant panel is diagnostic-only and fails closed (A16); a deliberately homogeneous panel is valid only as a labeled baseline/control that *measures* the redundancy collapse (`02 A37`, `05 §9b`, `07`)** · **A38 resource-bounded roster (#1 priority) — the optimal panel is the maximally diverse, maximally grounded embedder set that fits one 24 GB GPU (4090/5090-class) under ≤ 20 GB resident lens weights, covering every modality/domain (text general + legal/medical/clinical/biomedical/scientific/financial/code/multilingual · multiple image CLIP-style + DINO-style · audio speech/speaker/music/environmental · doc-image · protein/DNA/molecule); maximise count × measured `bits/VRAM-MB` (#729), quantise (INT8/FP16/MRL/static, A25) to fit more lenses; canonical catalogue + default "Constellation-24" panel in `05a`; admission = A35 + A37 + measured `Σ VRAM ≤ 20 GB` under the density packer + fused-RRF beats the 1–2-lens control (`02 A38`, `05a`, `DOCTRINE §10.29`)**.

## §7 — Bake the formulas in (canonical)

The Formula Library (`22`) is canonical and binding: every formula from the Royse corpus is a first-class, callable, self-optimizing backend primitive (DDA identity, meaning compression yield, KSG MI, differentiation contract, effective rank, DPI bound, grounding kernel/MFVS, `Gτ`, τ calibration, RRF, cross-terms, oracle self-consistency, panel sufficiency, hop-attenuation, Q↔A reversibility). The DB computes intelligence; the agent consumes it.

## §8 — Engineering rules

- **Rust, GPU math baked in** (`13`): CUDA sm_120 + SIMD, bit-parity tested; no external math service on the hot path.
- **One ordered transactional core** (Aster, FoundationDB-style): every paradigm is a key-encoding layer; ACID transactions make layers correct (`04`, `20`).
- **Fail closed** (A16): unknown lens, dim mismatch, ungrounded "trusted" result, corrupt shard, MI below quorum → structured error, never a silent fallback.
- **Provenance always** (Ledger, `11`): every vector, bit, kernel, guard verdict, oracle prediction, and answer traces to its grounded source and replays.
- **FSV** (§0): prove every claim by reading bytes; FSV harnesses are banned.
- **One change at a time; plan before architectural/storage/security changes; document failure as carefully as success.**
- **Code & test files ≤ 500 lines (HARD); documentation unlimited.** Documentation (these `.md` PRDs) may be as long as needed. **Every code and test file MUST be ≤ 500 lines.** When a file would exceed 500 lines, modularize per `docs2/modulateprompt.md`: split by single responsibility into a module directory with a thin facade (Rust `mod.rs` with explicit `pub use` re-exports — no wildcard), no circular dependencies, 100% backwards-compatible API (identical signatures/paths), all tests still passing; the original path becomes a < 100-line facade. **If an agent encounters any code/test file > 500 lines, it MUST open a GitHub issue to modularize that file, then resolve that issue** (perform the split, then verify `cargo check` + `cargo test` + `cargo clippy` clean and re-run the line-count check below). Track modularization debt as issues; never leave an over-limit file silently.
  ```bash
  # line-count gate (Rust): fail if any source/test file > 500 lines
  find crates -name '*.rs' -exec wc -l {} + | awk -v max=500 '$1>max && !/total/{print "❌",$0; v=1} END{if(!v)print "✅ all .rs ≤ 500 lines"}'
  ```

## §8b — Canonical protocols (binding references)

Three founder prompt-docs are **binding** on all work here. They override nothing in this charter; they operationalize it.

| Protocol | Doc | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Coding Agent Doctrine** | `docs2/AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md` | how code is written, debugged, verified, coordinated |
| **File Modularization** | `docs2/modulateprompt.md` | the ≤500-line rule + how to split (§8) |
| **Compression Doctrine** | `docs2/compressionprompt.md` | how prompts, docs, and code-comments are written (max signal / min token) |
| **Test Usefulness (Rust)** | `28 §6c` | what makes a test useful — FIRST, behavior-not-implementation, the two questions, property/fuzz/mutation, anti-flakiness, all Rust-tailored |

**No CI pipeline — FSV is our CI (binding).** Calyx has **no hosted CI/CD pipeline** (it would slow the build and cost money, A34). **FSV — manual source-of-truth readback on aiwonder (§0) — is our CI.** Tests (`cargo test` / `proptest` / `cargo-fuzz` / `cargo-mutants` / `criterion`, all OSS) are the fast inner loop and a *claim*; FSV reads the bytes and is the *truth gate*. Both run locally / on aiwonder, agent-invoked, never in a pipeline. A passing test never satisfies FSV (§0); a useful test must fail-when-wrong and pass-when-right (`28 §6c`).

**Synapse is the computer-use & orchestration runtime (binding, `31`).** For substantive dev work, agents use **Synapse** (perceive: `observe`/`read_text`/`find`; act: `act_type`/`act_launch`/`act_run_shell`; `reality_audit`) to operate the real machine and — its highest use — **open terminals and command other agents (Claude/Codex)** to build/test/verify Calyx on aiwonder. The commanded agents get full Synapse capabilities themselves. This is **preferred over the subagent tool** for anything that touches the machine, because it runs in real terminals with real FSV against real bytes. Synapse perception **is FSV's perception arm** (reads the *actual* terminal/test output, not a claimed return). Subagents stay for quick read-only fan-out only.

Key coding protocols pulled from `AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md` (embedded, not just referenced):
- **FSV is manual** (§0): the agent verifies the source of truth itself; no script/harness satisfies FSV. Four steps: read SoT before → act → read SoT after → inspect the delta.
- **Missing prerequisites are work, not blockers** — build the missing piece, don't stop.
- **Mental models, installed:** first-principles decomposition · symptom vs cause vs root cause · fail-closed not fail-open · defense in depth · asymmetry of risk · 80/20 · abductive hypothesis generation · contradiction engine · Linear Sequential Unmasking.
- **GitHub Issues are the coordination + memory surface:** read issue-state at the start of every turn; claim atomically before work; comment at every milestone; pause/blocked/done protocol; **dedupe before every create**; record decisions (ADR) and discoveries as issues. The §8 modularization rule files issues here.
- **FSV rigor:** ≥3 edge audits per code path (more for security); synthetic test data with known inputs/known expected outputs; aim for verification maturity L3+; **when a test fails, STOP** and root-cause.
- **RCA:** 5 Whys to a *structural* root cause, never "someone forgot."
- **Hypothesis-driven debugging:** scientific method — hypothesize, predict, test against the SoT.
- **No workarounds:** fail fast, fail loud; no fallback that hides failure (A16).
- **Anti-sycophancy:** never claim "Done" without evidence — open the diff, re-run, read the bytes (§0).
- **Be your own reviewer; forensic (Sherlock) discipline** for investigations; **web research = source over summarizer** (for engineering only, A24).

**Compression doctrine, applied to all writing here:** maximize specificity-per-token; cut what the model regenerates from priors (meta-noise, restatement, trivial examples); keep **verbatim** the No-Compress List — numbers/thresholds (`0.05 bits`, `0.6 corr`, `500 lines`, `τ`, `sm_120`), file paths, error codes (`CALYX_*`), axiom ids (`A1`–`A38`), formulas, named entities; structure over prose; canonical terms; round-trip to verify no meaning lost. **Documentation length is unlimited; density is still mandatory.**

## §8d — Development state via GitHub Issues (binding)

Dev state lives in the Calyx repo's **GitHub Issues** (`29`). A small curated set of pinned **`type:context`** issues (Mission & invariants · You-are-here · Environment & ops · Landmines · Datasets) holds the critical info **every agent MUST read at the start of every turn and keep in context.** They are **current-state snapshots, not journals**: pointers to docs (not copies), short enough to always fit context, with a last-verified stamp. **Keep them current by editing to the new truth — never append a contradiction.** **Prune every phase:** close done tasks, supersede + close old decisions, remove fixed gotchas, run a context-hygiene pass re-verifying each line against the bytes — so a fresh-context agent never sees a stale, confusing log. An issue is a claim; the bytes are the truth (§0). Read-state queries + taxonomy: `29`.

## §8f — Repo, PR, and aiwonder synchronization (binding)

Agents do not treat git/GitHub synchronization as cleanup. It is part of correctness. The local Calyx-Dev checkout, the aiwonder checkout, and the public Calyx mirror are separate physical source-of-truth states; a change is not current until each required state is updated and read back. At the start of substantive work, before commit/push, before any PR merge/update decision, and before final closeout, every agent checks: local worktree status, `origin/main`, open PRs, in-flight issue state, the aiwonder checkout at `/home/croyse/calyx/repo`, and the public Calyx mirror when the change is intended to leave Calyx-Dev. Long-running work repeats this scan periodically because other agents may push commits or PRs at any time. Agents `fetch --all --prune`, fast-forward when possible, inspect PRs before assuming the queue is unchanged, and never overwrite another agent's work. Verified changes are documented, committed, pushed, synced to aiwonder, and read back on Calyx-Dev, aiwonder, and the public mirror when public-bound; FSV evidence records the exact commit or dirty diff used. Closeout also updates the pinned current-state issue with the private commit, aiwonder commit/readback, public mirror commit when applicable, open PR state, and next issue queue head. Leaving verified work uncommitted or unpushed is allowed only when the issue/PR is updated with the blocker and exact repo state.

README imagery is public-bound source state. The repository root `README.md`
loads images from `assets/`; `docs/readme/` is contract/context only and MUST
NOT contain mirrored README image binaries. Any change touching `README.md`,
`assets/`, or `docs/readme/` runs `bash scripts/check_readme_assets.sh`, then
reads the emitted JSON under `target/fsv/readme-assets-contract/` or the
explicit `CALYX_FSV_ROOT` before commit and public mirror sync.

## §8c — Everything runs on aiwonder; secrets via Infisical (binding)

- **aiwonder is where the project exists.** This WSL dev box **authors** code only. The project is **built, stored, run, and tested on the `aiwonder` datacenter PC** (RTX 5090 sm_120, ZFS). The source-of-truth bytes that FSV reads live on aiwonder; a local run never counts as FSV (`28 §5`). **Build natively on aiwonder** under `CALYX_HOME=/home/croyse/calyx` (Rust via rustup is installed — the earlier "no `rustc` on the box → cross-build to `/opt/leapable/calyx/`" note is **superseded**; cross-build remains only an optional deploy path). Datasets + Aster vaults live on aiwonder ZFS. Reach it via the repo `.env` / `~/.config/aiwonder.env` (SSH/VPN/sudo bootstrap; `16 §0`). Current environment readback: `docs/implementation/01_AIWONDER_ENVIRONMENT.md`.
- **Secrets via Infisical** (`leapable-aiwonder-prod`, env `prod`). Calyx most likely needs **only `hf_hub_token`** (HuggingFace — models + datasets). Add any future secret (e.g. Kaggle creds) with `infisical secrets set …`; load via `infisical run …` or the rendered `/run/leapable/secrets/calyx.env`. **Never** put a secret *value* in a repo/issue/PR/chat — env-var names only. Catalog: `leapablememory/docs2/infisical-secrets-guide.md`; policy `16 §5b`.

## §8e — Agents handle every aspect of development, via Synapse (core, binding)

**Calyx is built by agents that handle every single aspect of development, autonomously, on aiwonder, using Synapse computer use** (`31`). This is core doctrine, not an aside. The agent loop — author, scaffold, build, test, **FSV**, acquire datasets, deploy, run ops, read dashboards, debug, coordinate, and **orchestrate other agents in real terminals — open a terminal and start Claude (`cldy`) or Codex (`codex --yolo`), then prompt them** (much more powerful than the subagent tool; each worker has full Synapse control, recursively) — runs through Synapse's full ability set: perceive (`observe`/`read_text`/`find`/**screenshot+AI-vision**), act (`act_run_shell`/`act_type`/`act_launch`), reality-audit (FSV's perception arm, §0), reactive `reflex_*`, recorded `audit_export_bundle` evidence. Web/dashboards: a **new tab in the one main Chrome** (auto-authed; `31 §6b`). Synapse-driven agents are **preferred over the subagent tool** for anything touching the machine, because they run in real terminals with real FSV against real bytes (`28 §2c`). Humans **direct and approve** outward-facing/destructive actions (§9, `31 §7`); everything else, agents do. The aim: **no aspect of development requires a human except direction and approval.**

## §9 — Anti-patterns (refuse these)

- Flattening the panel into one opaque vector (breaks A3 and the whole guard).
- Reporting `C(N,2)` abundance as new information beyond the DPI ceiling (A8).
- Labeling bits/kernel/guard "trusted" without grounding (A2) — say `provisional`.
- Mutating a frozen lens, or training on synthetic generator output (model collapse).
- Substituting an external theory of intelligence for the Royse corpus (§2).
- Making lens plug-in, bits, or kernel harder to reach (§5).
- A green-checkmark harness standing in for FSV (§0).
- **Validating, benching, or FSV-ing a retrieval/recall/signal/fusion/scale/SLO gate on fewer than 10 embedders or on synthetic vectors (A35).** A single lens is a vector DB, not the Constellation; 1–2 lenses cannot even be *valued* (value is associational — PID over ≥ 3, stable over ≥ 10). Every such run uses a real panel of **≥ 10 lenses** (scale toward 20+, resource-aware) and records per-lens bits + the ensemble decomposition + the fused result, or it fails closed. (The retired 4-lens bootstrap floor no longer satisfies any gate.)
- **Counting to 10 with redundant near-clones — e.g. ten general-purpose dense semantic embedders — and calling the panel diverse (A37).** The ≥ 10 count gate (A35) and the pairwise ≤ 0.6 contract (A7) are both *necessary but not sufficient*: 10 single-family models maximize redundancy (their PID bits are redundant, not unique/synergistic) and a panel can be collectively rank-deficient while every pair sits under 0.6. A gate-bearing panel MUST also span distinct association *families* and clear a **panel-level** redundancy bound (`n_eff`, mean corr/NMI, non-collapsing marginal-bits). A 10-by-count-but-redundant panel is diagnostic/control-only and fails closed for gates (A16).
- A code/test file over 500 lines without a tracking GitHub issue to modularize it (§8); or modularizing in a way that breaks the public API or adds a circular dependency.
- Bolting on a separate search/graph/vector DB instead of using the Association Engine that subsumes them (§3).

## §10 — Locked decisions (binding; the founder's directives, captured)

1. **Calyx is the universal database** — serves every paradigm's root purpose (`20`) — **and** the AGI/Oracle substrate (`21`). Use it for any project.
2. **Leapable is one project.** For Leapable, Calyx replaces **only** the SQLite/`sqlite-vec` Vaults; **PostgreSQL is untouched** (customers/billing/etc.). A greenfield project may use Calyx for everything (`15`, `20`).
3. **The kernel is computed at ANY scope** — all associations / a dataset / domain / subgraph / time window / tenant / any filter (`08 §4b`).
4. **Maximal compression, measured.** TurboQuant (founder-requested) + MXFP4 + the kernel; compress to the floor where Assay bits / Ward FAR / cosine / kernel-recall still hold (`23`, A25).
5. **Bounded, leak-free, self-reclaiming** — no managed-GC pauses, every allocation/cache/queue bounded, every DB-garbage reclaimed, fail closed under pressure (`24`, A26).
6. **Temporal lenses (E2/E3/E4) are for search/retrieval ONLY** (AP-60, never dominant); the **database's** temporal understanding of events/sequences/recurrence/time capture is a separate time-control layer for as-of reads and walking state forward/backward through time (`25`, A27).
7. **Deduplication is ONLY the TCT cosine-`Gτ` guard** over required **content** slots (no-flatten; temporal lenses excluded); recurrences collapse into one event + a time series; configurable at creation (`25`, A28).
8. **Plug-in lenses is THE backbone** — one call to add, one number for its bits, one call for the kernel at any scope (§5).
9. **Strictly the Royse corpus going forward** — fully custom-fitted; external technique frozen to founder-requested/platform-reality scaffolding only (§2, A24).
10. **Event-time is grounded reality.** The recurrence signature (content lenses agree + temporal lenses differ = the same action across time) is detected automatically; frequency/recurrence feeds oracle self-consistency, prediction, causal discovery, kernel importance, information/surprise — used optimally across the whole system (`25 §4c`, A29).
11. **Connections between truths are true.** The highest-probability grounded connection between two truths is itself true — the design method and a system capability; grounding/FSV confirms each discovered connection (`26 §11`, A30).
12. **Calyx is a living intelligence.** It runs the calculus of association continuously while healing, learning, and growing itself, so by the thesis it *is* an intelligent, life-like system — operational intelligence + life-like behavior (Living System Map, §1b), never a claim of consciousness (A31).
13. **Maximize grounded intelligence (the drive).** Every operation optimizes for maximum growth of grounded intelligence (`J`), fastest-first; the math self-adjusts its parameters online as new data arrives; compression-without-loss and retrieval efficiency are facets of this objective; bounded by grounding/DPI/differentiation/Goodhart-defense/reversibility — maximize *measured* intelligence, never delete data or game a number (§1c, A32, `27`).
14. **Everything on aiwonder.** Built, stored, run, tested, and state-resident on the aiwonder box; WSL authors only; FSV reads aiwonder's persisted bytes (§8c, `28 §5`, `16`).
15. **Code/test files ≤ 500 lines; docs unlimited.** Modularize per `modulateprompt.md`; over-limit file → GitHub issue + fix (§8). Protocols binding: `AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md`, `modulateprompt.md`, `compressionprompt.md` (§8b).
16. **FSV per aspect is defined** (`28`): synthetic deterministic data proves mechanics; a catalog of real datasets (text/code/graph/audio/image/temporal/adversarial, from HuggingFace/Kaggle) proves intelligence; acquisition is checksum-FSV'd; secret needed = `hf_hub_token` (Infisical).
17. **Dev state via GitHub Issues** (`29`, §8d): repo **`chrisroyse/calyx`**; pinned `type:context` issues every agent reads each turn; kept current by editing to truth (never appending contradictions); pruned every phase so fresh-context agents see a true, tight snapshot — not a confusing stale log.
18. **Security & privacy by construction** (`30`, A33): STRIDE-modeled, least-privilege, encrypted, default-deny tenant isolation; **right-to-erasure is first-class crypto-shredding** — A25 forbids deleting-*to-compress*, never lawful/user deletion; honest cold-start (search day 0, trust as anchors arrive).
19. **Project = Calyx** at `CALYX_HOME=/home/croyse/calyx` on aiwonder (self-contained; renamed from aidb); repo `ChrisRoyse/Calyx`. Build/run/test on aiwonder.
20. **Zero-cost & self-built** (`§1d`, A34): everything free, built in-house in Rust; no paid services/SaaS/cloud/CI/scanners; only conceivable paid item = a great embedder (doubted). Code every component ourselves; stay within these docs.
21. **No CI pipeline — FSV is CI** (`28 §6b`, §8b): tests = fast inner loop (claim); FSV = truth gate (reads bytes); both on aiwonder, agent-invoked, no hosted pipeline.
22. **Synapse for computer use & orchestration** (`31`): agents perceive/act on the real machine and open terminals to command Claude/Codex agents to build/test/verify — preferred over subagents; Synapse perception is FSV's perception arm.
23. **One main Chrome, new tabs only** (`31 §6b`): for any web/dashboard/account, agents use the operator's single already-logged-in main Chrome and open a **new tab** (auto-authenticated) — never a second Chrome/window/incognito/other browser; reuse + close the tab, never close Chrome.
24. **Screenshot + AI-vision is a primary perception mode** (`31 §6c`): Synapse `capture_screenshot` and the AI *looking at* the image is excellent for seeing what's actually going on — charts/graphs (Grafana), GUI state, error dialogs, rendered output that OCR/text can't capture; use it for FSV and dev observation.
25. **Agents handle every aspect of development** (`§8e`, `31 §6d`): via Synapse, agents author/build/test/FSV/deploy/debug/orchestrate end-to-end on aiwonder; humans only direct + approve outward/destructive actions. Core doctrine.
26. **Panel-not-lens — multi-embedder (≥ 10) is mandatory for ALL testing** (`02 A35`, `05 §9`, `07`, `28 §2`, §9): from here on, every test/bench/FSV/gate that touches retrieval, recall, signal/bits, fusion, scale, or an SLO runs a **real panel of ≥ 10 frozen lenses** and measures **per-lens bits + the ensemble decomposition (marginal value, cross-term/synergy gain, `n_eff`, panel sufficiency) + the fused (RRF) result**. The **4-lens bootstrap floor is retired** — it was only ever enough to stand up the fusion path; **≥ 10 is now required**, scaling toward **20+**, resource-aware (A26). Rationale: a lens's value is **associational, not intrinsic** — you cannot measure the worth of 1–2 embedders (value = unique+redundant+synergistic bits *relative to the rest of the panel*; **≥ 3 to begin, ≥ 10 for stable estimates**, per PID / interaction information / conditional MI), so single-/few-lens "gates" prove nothing and caused real hard failures. Single-embedder or synthetic-vector validation is **diagnostic-only** and **NEVER** satisfies a gate; an FSV artifact recording **< 10 real lenses fails closed** (A16). Roster/acquisition + measurement protocol: `05 §9`, `07`.
27. **Embedder templates — situation-specific, swappable ≥ 10-lens panels** (`02 A36`, `05 §7`/`§8`): the right 10+ lenses **differ by what is being measured** (video ≠ literary-essence ≠ code ≠ civic), so Calyx keeps a **library of named, versioned, content-addressed panel templates** the operator develops, profiles, saves, and **swaps in/out per vault or query** without re-embedding existing constellations (A5). Each template carries its **measured ensemble signal** (A35), so its fitness for a job is itself a number. The system templates sets of embedders and loads them on demand.
28. **Associational diversity — span types, not just count (A37)** (`02 A37`, `05 §9b`, `07`, §6/§9): the ≥ 10 floor (A35) is a **count** gate — satisfiable by 10 redundant dense-semantic clones that maximize redundancy and add almost nothing past the first few (PID: redundant, not unique/synergistic bits). The pairwise A7 contract (≤ 0.6 corr) is **necessary but not sufficient** — per-pair, it misses *collective* rank-deficiency. Every panel admitted for a test/bench/FSV/gate MUST also pass a **panel-level diversity gate**: (a) span distinct association **families** fit to the job — dense-semantic (general + domain) · lexical/sparse · entity/graph · character/byte · structural · reranker/asymmetric · temporal-sidecar (A27 time-control/as-of traversal); (b) clear a **panel-wide redundancy bound** — `n_eff` (A9) + mean pairwise corr/NMI thresholds, not just each pair ≤ 0.6; (c) show a **non-collapsing marginal-bits curve** — each lens contributes measurable **unique** PID bits given the rest. Diversity is a **recorded number** (`n_eff`, mean redundancy, Σ unique-PID-bits) on the EnsembleCard/template (A36). A 10-by-count-but-redundant panel is **diagnostic-only and fails closed** for gates (A16); a deliberately homogeneous panel is valid **only** as a labeled baseline/control that *measures* the redundancy collapse (the evidence for A37).
29. **The resource-bounded roster — the optimal panel for one 24 GB GPU (A38, #1 priority)** (`05a`, `02 A38`, `05 §9`/`§9b`, `07`, `13`, #729): the program's top objective is to **discover and maintain the maximally diverse, maximally grounded set of frozen embedders that fits one 24 GB GPU (4090/5090-class) under a ≤ 20 GB resident-lens-weight budget**, covering **every modality and domain a general database serves** — text (general semantic **+ legal · medical · clinical · biomedical · scientific · financial · code · multilingual**), **multiple image** embedders (zero-shot CLIP-style **and** self-supervised DINO-style — they see differently), **audio** (speech · speaker · music · environmental), document-image, and the science modalities (protein · DNA · molecule). **Maximise count × signal-density:** prefer **many small high-signal lenses** over a few giants; a lens earns its slot by **measured `bits / VRAM-MB`** (#729), not raw bits. **Quantise to fit** — ONNX **INT8** by default (≈ 4× < FP32, ≈ 2× < FP16, retrieval delta < `recall_delta`), FP16 for vision/audio, Matryoshka-truncation for MRL models, static/model2vec for the 0-VRAM baseline (A25 measured compression). The canonical candidate catalogue + the default panel (**"Constellation-24"**, Tier-1 ≈ 21 content lenses / ~9 families / ≈ 5–8 GB; Tier-2 → ~32 lenses / ≤ ~14 GB; Tier-3 giants one-at-a-time) lives in **`05a_EMBEDDER_ROSTER_VRAM_BUDGET.md`**. Admission = A35 (≥10 *learned* lenses) **+** A37 `gate_passed` **+** measured `Σ VRAM ≤ 20 GB` under the density packer **+** fused-RRF beats the 1–2-lens control. Budget is **not** the constraint — diversity and measured bits are; spend headroom on *more families*, never more dense-semantic clones. This subsumes and prioritises #26–#28.

---

**One sentence:** Calyx is the universal, association-native, self-optimizing database that serves every paradigm's root purpose and bakes in the Royse calculus-of-association — DDA, the differentiation contract, the multi-scope grounding kernel, `Gτ`, and the Oracle — so that plugging in a lens, reading its bits, and computing the kernel of any data is trivial, automatic, grounded, provenanced, and the heart of the formula for intelligence.
