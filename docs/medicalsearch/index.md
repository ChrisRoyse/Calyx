# Medical Search — Discovery Findings Log (index)

This directory is the **append-only record of all biomedical association-mining work**: every
search, exploration, calibration, sweep, chain walk, and hypothesis is written here as a dated
`.md` file. Nothing about the discovery program lives only in chat or in a GitHub comment — it lands
here, traceably.

- **Strategy / plan:** [`../../docs2/BIOMEDICAL_DISCOVERY_STRATEGY.md`](../../docs2/BIOMEDICAL_DISCOVERY_STRATEGY.md)
- **Recording rule:** one file per atomic task (named `NN_<topic>.md`), using `_TEMPLATE.md`.
  Record what was run, the exact commands, the raw outputs/FSV evidence, and the honest conclusion
  (including refusals + per-sensor deficits — a refusal is a finding, not a failure).
- **GitHub:** every file here corresponds to a `[DISCOVERY]` issue; cross-link both ways.

## Honesty contract (binding)
Only record a result as "grounded" if it cleared the Calyx honesty gate
(`I(panel;outcome) ≥ H(outcome)`). Never assert a capability or a finding that was not actually
run and verified against stored artifacts. A discovered association is a **ranked, traceable
hypothesis**, never a verdict — it carries its full provenance chain and a sufficiency proof, and
still requires experimental confirmation.
