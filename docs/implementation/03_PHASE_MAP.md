# 03 — Phase Map (PH00–PH72)

Every phase, in order, with stage, dependencies, the crate(s) it lands in, the
PRD roadmap phase + axioms it satisfies, and its one-line FSV exit gate. Detail
lives in the per-stage files (`10_…`–`30_…`). Phase IDs are stable handles.

Legend: **Dep** = phases that must be DONE first. **PRD** = `dbprdplans/19`
roadmap phase. **Gate** = the byte-level proof of done (full version in the
stage file). Status: **✅ DONE** · **▶ ACTIVE** (next up) · **· pending**.

> **Stage 1–5 audit note (2026-06-08):** Subagents and source readback found
> the pre-Lodestar Stage 1–5 hardening set #282-#292 is implemented and
> FSV-backed, with newly tracked follow-up gaps #293-#298 left open instead of

## Critical path & parallelism

- **Spine (must be serial):** PH00→PH04→PH05→…→PH09 (Aster core) →
  PH12/PH13 (Forge) → PH17→PH20 (lenses) → PH23/PH24 (search). This is the
  recommended first demo.
- **Parallelizable once the spine exists:** S5 (Loom/Assay) ∥ S7 (Ledger) ∥
  S12 (universal layer) ∥ S13 (resource) once Aster (S1) is up; S6 (Lodestar)
  needs S5's agreement graph; S8 (Ward) needs S3 + Forge; S10 (Anneal) needs
  S4 + S6. S13/S14 are **continuous hardening**, not a one-shot late stage.
- **Sudo-gated (operator):** ZFS dataset creation (PH00 relocation), systemd
  install (PH66) — never block dev; run from `CALYX_HOME` until provisioned.
