# 02 — Build Performance & Disk Hygiene

How Calyx builds fast and keeps the shared build host's disk bounded, and the
binding rule for **where each setting lives** so we never reintroduce the
machine-specific-config-in-git footgun (PR #662) or the runaway `target/` dir.

All builds happen on aiwonder (see `01_AIWONDER_ENVIRONMENT.md`): a Ryzen 9
9950X (16c/32t), 121 GiB RAM, RTX 5090, building a 18-crate Rust workspace.
Each worktree builds into its own target dir by default. A shared target dir is
allowed only when a command explicitly opts into it and then reads Cargo metadata
back to prove the target directory and workspace identity.

## 1. The two problems we fixed (measured 2026-06-12)

| Symptom | Root cause | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `target/` was **196 GB** for a 23 MB repo | Cargo never GCs superseded artifacts; the default `debug = 2` made every dev/test executable **~280 MB**, and continuous multi-agent rebuilds piled up **11,672** files in `deps/` (all < 14 days old — pure churn, not age) plus a **61 GB** `incremental/` cache | `du -sh target/debug/{deps,incremental}` = 131 GB + 61 GB; biggest files were ~280 MB `calyx-<hash>` test binaries; rlibs were only 6.3 GB |
| Link phase under-using the 32-core box | Default linker is `rust-lld` (good, default since Rust 1.90) but not as parallel as `mold`, which was installed but unconfigured | `which mold` = `/usr/bin/mold 2.40.4`; no `~/.cargo/config.toml` |

## 2. The fix, and the binding rule for where it lives

There are two classes of setting and they live in two different places **on
purpose**:

### Portable → committed in the repo
These are machine-agnostic and benefit every checkout (Linux, Windows, aiwonder), so
they belong in version control.

- **`Cargo.toml` `[profile.dev]` `debug = "line-tables-only"`** — keeps function
  names + `file:line` in panic/test backtraces (all the gate needs) while
  cutting executable size and link time several-fold.
- **`Cargo.toml` `[profile.dev.package."*"]` `debug = false`** — dependencies are
  never stepped into here; dropping their debuginfo is the single biggest
  `target/` size reduction with zero loss of first-party debuggability.
  (`profile.test` inherits `dev`, so `cargo test` binaries get this too.)
- **`scripts/check.sh` `export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`** — the gate is a one-shot
  build; incremental only adds overhead and disk churn there.

### Machine-specific → NOT committed (provisioned on the host)
A linker binary and a GC policy are properties of the *machine*, not the
project. Putting them in the repo's `.cargo/config.toml` would break Windows/local
authoring checkouts (an absolute mold path / a clang requirement they don't have) — the
exact class of bug PR #662 removed. They are provisioned by
**`scripts/aiwonder-build-setup.sh`**, which writes a Cargo config one level
*above* the repo, inside `CALYX_HOME`:

```
/home/croyse/calyx/.cargo/config.toml      # machine-local, gitignored by being outside repo/
  [build] incremental = false              # bound disk on this high-churn host
  [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
    linker = "clang"
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=mold"]
```

Cargo auto-discovers this for every build under `CALYX_HOME` (the repo and all
worktrees are children of it) **without** affecting other projects on the box
and **without** Windows/local authoring checkouts ever seeing it.

## 3. Test suite: all cores, not one (cargo-nextest)

`cargo test` compiles test binaries in parallel but then **runs each binary
sequentially**, so a 1500-test / 250-binary workspace leaves most of the 32
threads idle during the run. The gate uses **cargo-nextest**, which runs every
test across every binary in a single pool sized to all logical CPUs:

- **`scripts/check.sh`** runs `cargo nextest run --workspace` (parallel) then
  `cargo test --workspace --doc` (nextest does not execute doctests). It errors
  loudly if `cargo-nextest` is absent rather than silently skipping tests.
- **`scripts/install-cargo-nextest.sh` / `.ps1`** installs the official
  cargo-nextest prebuilt binary into the active Cargo bin directory and reads
  back `cargo nextest --version`. Use the Bash script for WSL/Bash and the
  PowerShell script for native Windows.
- **`.config/nextest.toml`** pins the policy: `test-threads = "num-cpus"`,
  `fail-fast = false` (surface every failure in one run), `retries = 0` (a flaky
  test fails loudly, never masked), and a generous hang timeout (~20 min) so a
  genuinely stuck test can't block the gate while legitimately long FSV/dataset
  tests are never falsely killed.
- Provisioned by `scripts/aiwonder-build-setup.sh`; no hosted pipeline installs
  or runs it.

## 4. Keeping target dirs bounded forever

Cargo has no built-in GC, and on this box churn (not age) is the enemy — age-
based pruning reclaims ~0 because everything is days old. So we bound by **size**:

- **`scripts/target-gc.sh`** runs `cargo sweep --maxsize ${CALYX_TARGET_MAXSIZE:-40GB}`,
  removing the oldest artifacts until the dir is under the cap. Worst case a
  stale crate recompiles next build — never a correctness issue.
- **`scripts/aiwonder-build-setup.sh`** installs a **daily user cron** (04:00 UTC,
  no sudo) that runs it against the canonical checkout's explicit shared target
  dir, logging to `CALYX_HOME/logs/target-gc.log`.
- The `incremental/` cache is always safe to delete manually for an instant
  reclaim: `rm -rf "$CARGO_TARGET_DIR"/debug/incremental`.

## 5. Verified worktree builds

FSV must never trust a `cargo build` return value alone. Use:

```bash
cd /home/croyse/calyx/wt-718
scripts/build-verified-calyx.sh \
  --target-dir "$PWD/target" \
  --expect-head "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  --require-clean \
  --require-string 'assay bits-validate'
```

The script defaults to `CALYX_CARGO_TARGET_DIR` when present, sets
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for that invocation, reads
`cargo metadata --no-deps` back to confirm `workspace_root` and
`target_directory`, builds `calyx-cli`, inspects the produced binary with
`strings`, reads the ELF dynamic section, and runs `ldd` with
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` cleared to prove all startup shared libraries resolve from
the binary's `RPATH` or system loader paths. A missing command string, dirty
worktree (when requested), wrong head, mismatched Cargo metadata, missing
`RPATH`, or unresolved dynamic library is a hard error.

## 6. Provisioning a (re)built host

```bash
cd /home/croyse/calyx/repo
bash scripts/aiwonder-build-setup.sh        # writes machine-local config, installs cargo-sweep + cron
scripts/build-verified-calyx.sh --require-string calyx   # verify binary identity
bash scripts/target-gc.sh                   # one manual GC pass (optional)
```

Everything is userspace and idempotent; re-run any time.

## 7. Why not also `target-cpu=native` / LTO / sccache?

- `target-cpu=native` and LTO help **runtime** performance but slow the dev/gate
  build and bust the cache; keep them for release/bench artifacts only, not the
  default profile that the gate uses.
- `sccache` was considered but adds a daemon + cache dir to manage; with mold +
  `line-tables-only` + bounded GC the build is already fast and the disk bounded,
  so it is intentionally **not** used to keep the toolchain simple. Revisit only
  if cold-cache dep builds become the bottleneck.
