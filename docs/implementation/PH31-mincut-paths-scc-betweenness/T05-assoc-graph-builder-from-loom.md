## Goal

Implement `build_assoc_graph`: the entry-point that reads Loom agreement scores +
directional confidence values from PH27, plus citation/entity edges from the
constellation store (PH09 anchors), and produces a complete `AssocGraph` for the
MFVS pipeline. Recurrence frequency (A29) is applied as node weight; the resulting
graph has edge weight = agreement × directional_confidence.

## Build (checklist of concrete, code-level steps)

- [ ] Define input types (can be simple structs for now; wired to real Loom output in PH32+):
  `AgreementEdge { src: CxId, dst: CxId, agreement: f32, directional_confidence: f32 }`,
  `FrequencyEntry { cx_id: CxId, frequency: f32 }`,
  `CitationEdge { src: CxId, dst: CxId }`.
- [ ] `pub fn build_assoc_graph(agreements: &[AgreementEdge], frequencies: &[FrequencyEntry], citations: &[CitationEdge]) -> Result<AssocGraph, CalyxError>`.
- [ ] For each `AgreementEdge`: `edge_weight = agreement * directional_confidence`;
  both values must be in `[0.0, 1.0]` or return `CALYX_GRAPH_INVALID_WEIGHT`.
- [ ] For each `FrequencyEntry`: node weight = `frequency` (≥ 1.0 required;
  < 1.0 → `CALYX_GRAPH_INVALID_WEIGHT`).
- [ ] For each `CitationEdge`: add edge with weight `1.0` (explicit provenance
  link; always fully trusted); skip if node not present → `CALYX_GRAPH_UNKNOWN_NODE`.
- [ ] Deduplication: parallel edges keep the max weight (citation edges can overlap
  with agreement edges — keep max).
- [ ] Function is pure: same inputs → identical `AssocGraph` byte-for-byte (sorted
  CSR ensures determinism).

## Tests (synthetic, deterministic — known input → known bytes/number)

- [ ] unit: 3 agreements `A→B (0.8, 0.9)`, `B→C (0.6, 0.7)`, `C→A (1.0, 1.0)`;
  expected edge weights: `0.72`, `0.42`, `1.0`; verify with `out_neighbors`.
- [ ] unit: frequency `[A=2.0, B=1.0]`; `node_weight(A)` = `2.0`, `node_weight(B)` = `1.0`.
- [ ] unit: citation edge `A→C` alongside agreement `A→C (0.3, 0.5)`;
  final weight = `max(1.0, 0.15)` = `1.0`.
- [ ] proptest: for `n` non-overlapping agreement edges, `edge_count(graph)` = `n`.
- [ ] edge: empty input arrays → valid empty graph (0 nodes, 0 edges), no error.
- [ ] edge: agreement with both `src` and `dst` equal (self-loop) → accepted,
  edge weight = `agreement * directional_confidence`.
- [ ] fail-closed: `agreement = 1.1` → `CALYX_GRAPH_INVALID_WEIGHT`;
  `frequency = 0.5` (< 1.0) → `CALYX_GRAPH_INVALID_WEIGHT`.

## FSV (read the bytes on aiwonder — the truth gate)

- **SoT:** `cargo test -p calyx-mincut graph_builder -- --nocapture` stdout.
- **Readback:** `cargo test -p calyx-mincut graph_builder 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ph31_t05_fsv.txt && cat /tmp/ph31_t05_fsv.txt`.
- **Prove:** unit test prints the three edge weights `0.72, 0.42, 1.0` for the
  triangle; citation-merge test prints final weight `1.0`; all tests pass;
  output attached to PH31 GitHub issue.

## Done when

- [ ] `cargo check` + `clippy -D warnings` + `test` green on aiwonder
- [ ] file(s) ≤ 500 lines (line-count gate ✅)
- [ ] FSV evidence (readback output / screenshot) attached to the PH31 GitHub issue
- [ ] no anti-pattern (DOCTRINE §9): no flatten / no `C(N,2)` past DPI / nothing
      "trusted" without grounding / no frozen-lens mutation / no harness-as-FSV
