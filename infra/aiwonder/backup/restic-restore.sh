# restic-restore.sh — Calyx DR drill restore (PH67 T04, issue #544).
#
# Usage: bash restic-restore.sh <snapshot-id|latest> <restore-target-dir>
# IMPORTANT: <restore-target-dir> must be inside a ZFS dataset to avoid EXDEV.
#   Recommended: /zfs/archive/calyx/dr-staging  (same pool as the restic repo)
# POSTURE: single-host. RPO = last restic snapshot. RTO = restore + verify time.
#          Whole-host loss is accepted posture for this deployment.
#
# restic recreates the snapshot's ABSOLUTE source path under --target (there is
# no --strip-components), so a vault backed up from /zfs/hot/calyx lands at
# <target>/zfs/hot/calyx. This script locates the restored vault root (the parent
# of the restored wal/ dir) and prints the exact verify-restore command.
